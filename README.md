# Hel
Hel is a general purpose C++14 library.

## Design
With the help of C++14 features, I try to design this library with a few unusual constraints aimed at making the interface and the implementation simpler (compared to e.g. Boost libraries):
* No explicit or partial specialization of templates
* No "details" namespaces, every namespace scoped entities are part of the public interface.

## Why "Hel"?
Hel is the daughter of Loki.
